# Diagnostic test assessment
The project output is a diagnostic test accuracy and utility dashboard. Provided with metrics of disease prevalence, sensitivity and specificity, the dashboard yields more useful metrics, including overall test accuracy, post-test probabilities, and the net benefit over a reference standard. The dashboard was developed as a Shiny integration to Quarto.
